## Ideas

- Identify most trafficked times to increase number of exposures.
- Identify demographic to target and locations of those demographics.
    - Women
    - Technical, engineering work places
    - Business women
    - People who like to donate
    - Affluent neighborhoods
- How many volunteers?  i.e. How many locations to identify.
